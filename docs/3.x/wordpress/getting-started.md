# Matomo for WordPress

The [Matomo Analytics for WordPress plugin](https://github.com/matomo-org/wp-matomo/) lets users install a fully functioning Matomo within their WordPress in just a few seconds.

As a developer, you can create WordPress plugins that hook into our WordPress plugin to provide new functionality such as:

* Showing metrics / reports in various places within WordPress. For example showing the number of visits of a currently viewed page in the WordPress admin bar. This gives users more context and insights.
* Provide shortcuts to specific actions in Matomo. For example, a plugin may show a link to view the [Page Overlay](https://matomo.org/docs/page-overlay/) for a specific page with just one click while viewing a page.
* Modify Matomo's tracking code to track more data out of the box
* Add, remove or customise the behaviour of certain features within Matomo
* Improve integration with other WordPress plugins (eg Ecommerce, forms, ...)
* And much more, the sky is the limit!
