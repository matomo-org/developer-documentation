# Getting Started Part III: Extras

## About this guide

In [Part II](/guides/getting-started-part-2) you created a plugin that defines and displays a new report. In this guide, we'll enhance that plugin by making it configurable and internationalized. You'll learn:

* **how to add settings to your plugin**
* **how to make your plugin available in multiple languages**

**Guide Assumptions**

This guide assumes that you've completed [Part II](/guides/getting-started-part-2) of this guide.

### Making the report configurable

The report we've defined is interesting, but we could easily aggregate on another visit property. For example, the report could be `getLastVisitsByScreenType` or `getLastVisitsByCity`. In this section, we're going to make it possible for users to change what the report displays.

#### Creating a plugin setting

We'll create a **plugin setting** which will control which visit property the plugin uses to generate our report. For this, we need to create a `Settings` class at the root of your plugin's directory:

```php
namespace Piwik\Plugins\MyPlugin;

class Settings extends \Piwik\Plugin\Settings
{
    protected function init()
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

The `Settings` class is a special class that is automatically detected by Piwik. Piwik uses the information it sets to add a new section for your plugin in the _Plugins > Settings_ admin page.

We're going to create one setting that can be set differently by each user. Our setting will determine the column of the `Live.getLastVisitsDetails` that we'll aggregate by. So it's a string and has a limited number of valid values. We'll use a single select dropdown (just a normal `<select>`) for it.

Let's add an attribute and new method for this setting:

```php
class Settings extends \Piwik\Plugin\Settings
{
    public $realtimeReportDimension;

    protected function init()
    {
        $this->realtimeReportDimension = $this->createRealtimeReportDimensionSetting();
        $this->addSetting($this->realtimeReportDimension);
    }

    private function createRealtimeReportDimensionSetting()
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

Then we'll implement the `createRealtimeReportDimensionSetting()` method:

```php
    private function createRealtimeReportDimensionSetting()
    {
        $setting = new \Piwik\Settings\UserSetting('reportDimension', 'Report Dimension');
        $setting->type = self::TYPE_STRING;
        $setting->uiControlType = self::CONTROL_SINGLE_SELECT;
        $setting->description   = 'Choose the dimension to aggregate by';
        $setting->availableValues = MyPlugin::$availableDimensionsForAggregation;
        $setting->defaultValue = 'browserName';
        
        return $setting;
    }
```

Notice how `$settings->availableValues` is set from `MyPlugin::$availableDimensionsForAggregation`. The **availableValues** property should be set to an array mapping column values with their appropriate display text. This array will probably come in handy later so we'll put it in a static class attribute.

In your plugin class add the following code:

```php
    public static $availableDimensionsForAggregation = array(
        'browserName' => 'Browser',
        'visitIp' => 'IP',
        'visitorId' => 'Visitor ID',
        'searches' => 'Number of Site Searches',
        'events' => 'Number of Events',
        'actions' => 'Number of Actions',
        'visitDurationPretty' => 'Visit Duration',
        'country' => 'Country',
        'region' => 'Region',
        'city' => 'City',
        'operatingSystem' => 'Operating System',
        'screenType' => 'Screen Type',
        'resolution' => 'Resolution'

        // we could add more, but let's not waste time.
    );
```

If you go to the _Plugins > Settings_ admin page you should see this new setting:

<img src="/img/myplugin_settings_page.png"/>

#### Using the new setting

To use the setting, we first need to get the setting value in our API method and then aggregate using it. Change your API method to this:

```php
    public function getLastVisitsByBrowser($idSite, $period, $date, $segment = false)
    {
        // get realtime visit data
        $data = \Piwik\Plugins\Live\API::getInstance()->getLastVisitsDetails(
            $idSite,
            $period,
            $date,
            $segment,
            $numLastVisitorsToFetch = 100,
            $minTimestamp = false,
            $flat = false,
            $doNotFetchActions = true
        );
        $data->applyQueuedFilters();

        // read the setting value that contains the column value to aggregate by
        $settings = new Settings('MyPlugin');
        $columnName = $settings->realtimeReportDimension->getValue();

        // we could create a new instance by using new DataTable(),
        // but we would loose DataTable metadata, which can be useful.
        $result = $data->getEmptyClone($keepFilters = false);

        foreach ($data->getRows() as $visitRow) {
            $columnValue = $visitRow->getColumn($columnName);

            $resultRow = $result->getRowFromLabel($columnValue);

            // if there is no row for this browser, create it
            if ($resultRow === false) {
                $result->addRowFromSimpleArray(array(
                    'label'     => $columnValue,
                    'nb_visits' => 1
                ));
            } else { // if there is a row, increment the counter
                $counter = $resultRow->getColumn('nb_visits');
                $resultRow->setColumn('nb_visits', $counter + 1);
            }
        }

        return $result;
    }
```

Now we'll want to make sure the column heading in the report display has the correct text. Right now, it will display **Browser** no matter what the setting value is:

<img src="/img/myplugin_incorrect_browser_header.png"/>

Change the `configureView()` method in the **getLastVisitsByBrowser** report to the following:

```php
    public function configureView(ViewDataTable $view)
    {
        // The ViewDataTable must be configured so the display is perfect for the report.
        // This is done by setting properties of the ViewDataTable::$config object.
        $view->config->show_table_all_columns = false;

        $settings = new Settings('MyPlugin');
        $columnToAggregate = $settings->realtimeReportDimension->getValue();
        $columnLabel = MyPlugin::$availableDimensionsForAggregation[$columnToAggregate];

        $view->config->addTranslation('label', $columnLabel);

        $view->config->columns_to_display = array_merge(array('label'), $this->metrics);
    }
```

Open the report and you'll now see:

<img src="/img/myplugin_correct_browser_header.png"/>

#### Rename the report

Finally, we'll rename the report. After all, it can do more than just aggregate the last 100 visits by browser now. Rename all occurences of `getLastVisitsByBrowser` to `getLastVisitsByDimension`. Make sure you replace it in the following files:

* API.php
* Reports/GetLastVisitsByBrowser.php (The filename has to be renamed to **GetLastVisitsByDimension.php** as well)
* plugin.js

### Internationalizing your plugin

The other improvement we'll make to our plugin is to use Piwik's [internationalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization) system so our plugin can be made available in multiple languages.

Internationalization is achieved in Piwik by replacing translated text, like `"Realtime Analytics"`, with unique identifiers, like `"MyPlugin_RealtimeAnalytics"` called **translation tokens**.

Translation tokens are associated with translated text in multiple JSON files, one for each supported language. In the code, the translation tokens are converted into translated text based on the user's selected language.

#### Locating the language file

To internationalize our plugin, an english language file to hold our translated text is needed. This file is already created for you by the report generator. It is located in your plugin's `lang/` directory. In that folder, a file named `en.json` should exist containing translations:

```json
{
    "MyPlugin": {
        "LastVisitsByBrowser":"Last Visits By Browser"
    }
}
```

We're going to move all of the translated text of our plugin into this file.

#### Internationalizing our Report

We use one piece of translated text in our report: `"Real-time reports"`. First, we'll add entries for it in the `en.json` file we just located. We'll use the **RealtimeReports** translation token:

```json
{
    "MyPlugin": {
        "RealtimeReports": "Real-time reports"
    }
}
```

Then replace the text in your report class `GetLastVisitsByDimension` with the following:

```php
$this->menuTitle   = 'MyPlugin_RealtimeReports';
$this->widgetTitle = $this->menuTitle;
```

#### Internationalizing our setting

Let's internationalize the text we use in our `Settings` class. First, we'll add entries for the text we use:

```json
{
    "MyPlugin": {
        "RealtimeReports": "Real-time reports"
        "ReportDimensionSettingDescription" : "Choose the dimension to aggregate by"
    }
}
```

Then we'll use the new translation token in the `createRealtimeReportDimensionSetting()` method:

```php
$setting->description = \Piwik::translate('MyPlugin_ReportDimensionSettingDescription');
```

We also need to internationalize the names of each possible setting value. We'll do this by using translated text in the `MyPlugin::$availableDimensionsForAggregation` static variable. Of course, we can't call [Piwik::translate](/api-reference/Piwik/Piwik#translate) when setting a static field, so we'll have to add a new method that returns the array.

We're not going to add any translation tokens to `en.json` this time because the translations already exist in core plugins. Replace `MyPlugin::$availableDimensionsForAggregation` field with this:

```php
public static $availableDimensionsForAggregation = array(
    'browser' => 'UserSettings_ColumnBrowser',
    'visitIp' => 'General_IP',
    'visitorId' => 'General_VisitorID',
    'searches' => 'General_NbSearches',
    'events' => 'Events_NbEvents',
    'actions' => 'General_NbActions',
    'visitDurationPretty' => 'VisitorInterest_ColumnVisitDuration',
    'country' => 'UserCountry_Country',
    'region' => 'UserCountry_Region',
    'city' => 'UserCountry_City',
    'operatingSystem' => 'UserSettings_ColumnOperatingSystem',
    'screenType' => 'UserSettings_ColumnTypeOfScreen',
    'resolution' => 'UserSettings_ColumnResolution'

    // we could add more, but let's not waste time.
);
```

Then, add this method to your plugin's plugin descriptor class:

```php
public static function getAvailableDimensionsForAggregation()
{
    return array_map(array('Piwik', 'translate'), self::$availableDimensionsForAggregation);
}
```

Finally in the `createRealtimeReportDimensionSetting()` method, replace `MyPlugin::$availableDimensionsForAggregation` by `MyPlugin::getAvailableDimensionsForAggregation()`.

#### Internationalizing report column headers

Since we already use translation tokens in the `MyPlugin::$availableDimensionsForAggregation` field, and the column headers are set using the same data, all we have to do is use `MyPlugin::getAvailableDimensionsForAggregation` in the `configureView()` report method:

```php
$columnTranslations = MyPlugin::getAvailableDimensionsForAggregation();
$columnLabel = $columnTranslations[$columnToAggregate];
```
