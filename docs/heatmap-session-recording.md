# Heatmap & Session Recording

This section contains guides that will help you to customize the generation of heatmaps and the recording of sessions. 
By default, no changes in your tracking code or website are needed as everything works automatically.

Heatmaps let you view visually all clicks, mouse moves, and scroll activities of your visitors within a certain page. This helps you for example to find out where users think something is clickable but is not, whether there are parts of the page that are being barely viewed or interacted with, what your visitors are looking for, how much of the page is visible when users view your page, and more.

Session recordings let you view all activities such as clicks, mouse movements, scrolls, window resizes, page changes, and form interactions of a real visitor on a certain page. You can replay these interactions in a video to see exactly how a visitor interacted with your website. This way you understand their expectations, problems they may have, usage patterns, and more.
