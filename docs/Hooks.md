Hooks
==========

On this page you will learn how to use as well as how to trigger hooks. All already existing hooks are listed below.

## Usage

#### Register an action for a given hook
If you want to listen to a specific event, and trigger your own function when this event is posted, you have to define a method `getListHooksRegistered()` in your plugin class, that will return an array containing pair of (hook name, method to call).

For example if you want to execute your function `AddCityInformation()` when a new visitor is recorded by Piwik (hook `Tracker.newVisitorInformation`), in your class `MyPlugin` you would define a method:

```
function getListHooksRegistered()
{
    return array( 'Tracker.newVisitorInformation' => 'AddCityInformation' );
}
```

The hook `Tracker.newVisitorInformation` has an argument: an array containing the visitor’s information. You can add new elements to this array. Example:

```
function AddCityInformation( &$visitorInfo )
{
    // we modify the variable, adding the new city field
    $visitorInfo['city'] = 'Paris, France';
}
```

You can have a look at the [provider plugin](https://github.com/piwik/piwik/blob/master/plugins/Provider/Provider.php#L31) to see an example of a plugin registering actions for multiple hooks.

Piwik also provides a means of dynamic hook registration using `Piwik_AddAction($eventName, $callback)`.

#### Add a new hook
Plugins can themselves post new events, the same way Piwik posts events. A common example is custom page headers and footers (on a per plugin basis).

```
Piwik_PostEvent( $eventName,  [ $object , [ $info ]])
```

or in Twig templates:

```
{{ postEvent($eventName) }}
```
By convention, the event name should be prefixed by the Plugin name.
