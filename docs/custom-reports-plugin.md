# Custom Reports (Plugin)

The [Custom Reports](https://plugins.matomo.org/CustomReports) plugin lets you create new reports without having
to hire a developer.

Defining a new report involves picking one or more dimensions to compute metrics for and one or more metrics to compute:

The dimensions determine what the labels of each report are, and the metrics determine the rest of the columns.

The first dimension you pick is the main dimension of the report. Each subsequent dimension creates a subtable report
with that dimension:

With the **Custom Reports** plugin, you can pick & choose the metrics that matter most to you and your business.

This section contains the following reference material related to CustomReports:

* **Dimensions & Metrics**: Lists every dimension and metric you can use with CustomReports (some of these may be availble only when other premium plugins are activated).
